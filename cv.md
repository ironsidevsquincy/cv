I have nineteen years of professional Web Development experience. I have worked on high-profile, high-traffic websites, constrained by tight or immovable deadlines. I have led development teams, acting in both a mentoring and project-leadership role. I am a self-motivated worker, quick to pick-up new techniques and technologies, who would fit into any company.

## Professional Experience

### Engineering Manager/Product Owner at Klarna (Berlin)
Mar 2018 - Present

After joining Klarna as a Senior Engineer, I am now currently the Engineering Manager/Product Owner of a team of 5 engineers.
Our primary focus is the B2B portal, used by nearly 700,000 of Klarna's merchants. The portal is made up of a series of apps that allow our merchants to, among other things, monitor and manage their orders, view disputes and settlements and access information about their account.
As a platform team, our goal is to enable 15 other teams to easily build and deploy changes to the portal. We architect how these apps are built and run, as well as maintaining the pipeline for getting code into production.
Currently, we are integral to reaching Klarna's company-wide goal to allow external payment service providers (e.g. Stripe) to easily integrate with us. The team is a critical part of this project, designing and building external-facing APIs.

### Senior Developer at 101 Ways (London)
Jul 2017 - Jan 2018 (7 months)

As a freelancer, I worked at the Arcadia Group. The project was a rebuild of the websites for shops within their multi million pound portfolio (e.g. Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge). This project had strict requirements, as we were limited by complex existing data, and involved working within tight deadlines.
As many developers were junior or mid level within the team, I took a leadership role, pairing with them to work through problems.

### Front End Developer at The Financial Times (London)
Mar 2015 - Jun 2017 (2 years, 4 months)

During my time at the FT, I was a core member of a multidisciplinary team that redesigned and built the paper's website. It was a high-performing site, serving ~2 million requests per day, aiming for a 'load to read' time of 1.5 seconds.
I also worked closely with the paper's journalists to scope and build an internal tool that could be used throughout the globe to upload video assets, attach metadata and captions, and deploy to the site in minutes.

### Senior Web Developer The Guardian (London)
Jul 2012 - Feb 2015 (2 years, 8 months)

At The Guardian I worked on the redesign and build of the new responsive website. As this is an internationally renowned newspaper, it had to handle a high load, around the clock, serving ~10 million requests per day.
I worked very closely (daily stand-ups, regular meetings, showcases) with both journalists and the creative director to both interpret and realise their vision.

### Principal Web Developer at The BBC (London)
Oct 2005 - Jul 2012 (6 years, 10 months)

Over nearly seven years, I worked on many different projects, starting as a Junior Web Developer, and through the years working up to Principal Web Developer. This meant I was exposed to many different codebases, colleagues (and their style of working), processes (agile, waterfall), tools and technologies. As such, I developed the skills to easily integrate into a team and adapt to any situation, as well as voicing my opinions and ideas.
My final project was Tech Lead on the London 2012 Olympics site, which involved leading seven developers, making architectural and ongoing design decisions, and working closely with the Product Owner and Business Analysts. It was also one of the first sites to utilise new data technologies (the BBC's (semantic) linked data).
