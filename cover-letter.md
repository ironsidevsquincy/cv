Dear Sir/Madam

I am a passionate Web Developer with many years of professional experience. I would love to not only bring my knowledge to your company, but also learn from the unique problems you are solving. Here are two reasons why I think I would be a good fit for this role

* I have extensive (10 years+) full stack experience, including 5 years of Node.js and 2 years of React, working on high-traffic sites (~2 million requests per day)
* I have a strong background in, and take most enjoyment from, working on multi-disciplinary teams. I have worked on two sites (The Financial Times and The Guardian) from inception to launch, working closely with UX and stakeholders, helping them to shape the product

Thank you for considering me for this role

Darren Hurley
