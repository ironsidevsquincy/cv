Hi!

I am a passionate Web Developer with over 17 years of professional experience. I would love to not only bring my knowledge to your company, but also learn from the unique problems you are solving. Here are three reasons why I think I would be a good fit for this role.

* I have extensive (17 years+) full stack experience, including JavaScript/Node.js, React, Scala and Ruby, working on high-traffic sites (~2 million requests per day).
* I take most enjoyment from working in multi-disciplinary teams. I have worked on two sites (The Financial Times and The Guardian, both content-heavy) from inception to launch to maintenance. I worked closely with UX, Product and Editorial stakeholders, helping them to shape the product.
* I am an experienced technical leader due to my many years of working on a wide variety of products, from architecting green-field propositions to maintaining legacy systems. In my current role as Engineering Manager, I also use my knowledge to mentor and coach more Junior Engineers.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Darren Hurley
